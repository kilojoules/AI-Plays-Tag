# Master TODO

Legend:
- [ ] not started
- [I] in progress
- [x] done / merged

## Current Focus
- [x] Align repo with PRD goals: prune obsolete scaffolding and track follow-ups via component sub TODOs.

## Backlog Index
- [x] Godot backlog — see `godot/TODO.md` (camera framing + NPC audit completed, see regression tests).
- [x] Trainer backlog — see `trainer/TODO.md` (PPO refactor, policy split, and checkpoint safeguards complete).
- [x] Scripts backlog — see `scripts/TODO.md` (debug bundling + Pixi automation complete).
- [x] Documentation backlog — see `docs/TODO.md` (reward notes + workflow guides complete).

## Notes
- Update the checkboxes in the sub TODO files directly; reflect high-level status flips here once merged.
